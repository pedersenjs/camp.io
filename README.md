# Camp.io
Jenna Pedersen and Patrick Turner
Type of your project: Mobile app (Android and iOS)
Domain of your project: Recreation

Camp.io will provide a robust system for users to track campsites they have been to as well as discover new campsites. Users will be able to add photos and ratings of a location they have camped at, and other users will be able to comment on the review. Users will also be able to add campsites to a list. Users will be able to save a campsite locally on their device, or make it public for all users to see.
